# Experience Shared Components

This directory contains components shared across multiple components in the `components/pages/experience` directory.

They will not be exported by `components/pages/experience/index.tsx`, meaning they should be considered "private", and not consumed outside of the `experience` components.

If they become more common &mdash; and shared across other pages &mdash; they can be moved to `components/sormus`.
