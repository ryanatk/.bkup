            You can track your heart health with daytime and nighttime heart
            rate tracking, workout heart rating tracking, nighttime heart rate

          <DescriptionItem icon="lungs" title="Blood oxygen sensing (SpO2)">
            By detecting your blood oxygen levels at night, Oura can tell if
            you&apos;re experiencing any breathing disturbances that may
            interrupt your sleep.

          <DescriptionItem icon="target" title="Accuracy Above All">
            The Oura Ring is designed for accuracy above all because it measures
            from the palm side of your finger, where the pulse signal is
            strongâ€”much stronger than the top of your wrist (doctors measure
            your heart rate from your finger for a reason)
          </DescriptionItem>

          <DescriptionItem icon="zzz" title="Measure Your HRV">
            Your Sleep Score is made up of seven Sleep Contributors including
