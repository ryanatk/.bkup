# Banner

The `Banner` component is available for creating immersive call to actions.

## Banner height

The height of the banner is controlled by the size of the image, which allows control over the focal point of the image and how it relates to the content. _Note:_ if the image is too shallow, content could overflow and not be visible.

## Content placement

On small screens, content is anchored from the center of the Y axis. On "medium" screens or larger, content is anchored from the center of the X axis.

## Props

### Required

1. `imageSrc`: The source of the default image (displays on smallest screens)
2. `imageSrcDesktop`: The source of the "desktop" image, which will be displayed once the screen size is "medium" or larger

### Optional

1. `imageLoading`: Applies to the `loading` attribute of the image. [See docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading)
2. `backgroundColor`: Background color of the banner while the image is loading.
