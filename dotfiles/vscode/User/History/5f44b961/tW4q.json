  "sleep_features_sleep_score_description": "Your Oura sleep score (ranges from 1-100) tells you how well you sleep every night.

  "sleep_features_sleep_sounds_title": "Sleep sounds & biofeedback",
  "sleep_features_sleep_stages_description": "Oura tracks all 4 sleep stages: Deep sleep (physically restorative stage), REM sleep (mentally restorative stage), Light sleep, and Awake periods. You'll know if you're spending getting enough time in each sleep stage. Accuracy comparable to gold standard sleep lab testing.",

  "sleep_features_variant_title": "Here are six ways Oura Ring works with you to improve your sleep",
  "sleep_insights_devin_m": "Oura, more than any other device, drives behavior change. It creates feedback loops which allow people to see how their actions during the day are related to their sleep at night.",
  "sleep_insights_geoff_a": "I never realized how awful my sleep pattern was until I got this ring. That together with whether my sleep was actually \"sound\" or \"restless\" has made the world of difference to how I approach the time leading up to my rest these days. Also, it looks pretty good too.",
  "sleep_insights_helma_l": "Oura gave me insight into my sleep patterns. And by making some adjustments I sleep better, feel more rested and I can achieve more goals during the day. The best part is Oura telling me to chill when I am about to go beyond my boundaries.",
  "sleep_insights_paul_g": "The Oura is perfect to see and review my quality of sleep each night. This allows me to experiment with behaviors and change habits to sleep better and better. The ring is unobtrusive unlike a watch device which bothers me to wear.",
  "sleep_insights_title": "Oura has logged over 2.5 billion hours of sleep for our members",
  "sleep_insights_variant_title": "Just take a listen to a few experiences.",
  "sleep_tips_bedtime_description": "Try to set a reasonable bedtime window and stick to it, even on weekends. Consistency in how you sleep and your length of sleep helps maintain your natural circadian rhythm, improve the quality of your sleep, and wake up rested and ready when your morning alarm goes off.",
  "sleep_tips_bedtime_title": "Stick to your recommended bedtime, even on weekends.",
  "sleep_tips_caffeine_description": "If you’re feeling tired later in the day, resist that afternoon or evening caffeine boost. Caffeine has a half-life of five to seven hours, so if you have a cup of coffee at 3pm, half of the caffeine is still in your system by 8pm. It raises your heart rate, making it more difficult to fall asleep and can disrupt your internal clocks. Keep in mind that soda, tea, and chocolate can also contain enough caffeine to disrupt sleep.",
  "sleep_tips_caffeine_title": "Curb your post-lunch caffeine consumption.",
  "sleep_tips_daytime_schedule_description": "An elevated metabolism or heart rate can disrupt your sleep, so it’s best to stop strenuous exercise and halt heavy meals at least 3 hours before your ideal bedtime.",
  "sleep_tips_daytime_schedule_title": "Schedule your large meals and heavy workouts for daytime.",
  "sleep_tips_dedicated_space_description": "If you can, create a dedicated space in your home or apartment just for sleep. Your internal clocks respond to these sleep cues and your body will thank you. Try to reserve your bedroom for sleep, recovery, and intimacy. Keep your other living spaces for media consumption, work, dining, etc. Ideas? Remove the bedroom TV, leave your phone and charger on the kitchen counter, and making sure your work-from-home setup isn’t next to your bed.",
  "sleep_tips_dedicated_space_title": "Reserve your bedroom for rest and recovery.",
  "sleep_tips_keep_cool_description": "Your body temperature decreases to initiate sleep, so a cool room can give you a head start. Physiology and science both point to the ideal nighttime room temperature being around 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). Adjust your bedding with the seasons. On especially warm nights? Put your pillowcase in the freezer for a few minutes just before bed. Too cold? Add a blanket…or three.",
  "sleep_tips_keep_cool_title": "Keep it cool. Help your body initiate sleep.",
  "sleep_tips_min_light_description": "Electronic devices (and much of the inside lighting we use in our homes and offices) emit high-intensity blue light that gets misinterpreted as daylight. Your eyes send a message to your brain that the sun is still shining, and you are on high alert. So at least an hour before bed, try to turn off the TV and put away your phone and tablet.",
  "sleep_tips_min_light_title": "Minimize blue-light exposure before bed.",
  "sleep_tips_nap_description": "Taking a nap is a great way to recover after a rough night of sleep. If you need some midday shut-eye, nap between 10-45 minutes. But make sure it’s before 3pm. Naps too close to your ideal bedtime can make it difficult to get to sleep at night.",
  "sleep_tips_nap_title": "Nap. Nap. Nap…before 3 p.m.",
  "sleep_tips_nightcap_description": "Alcohol inhibits the release of melatonin, your body’s primary sleep signal. It is NOT a sleep aid. Alcohol may help you feel relaxed before bed, but it can rob you of highly valuable REM sleep and deep sleep. On nights when you have a few drinks, try to hydrate frequently, and give your body at least three hours before bed to metabolize the alcohol from your system (this varies by your weight, gender, and consumption).",
  "sleep_tips_nightcap_title": "Say no to the nightcap.",
  "sleep_tips_summary": "Try any of them out! If you want to see which of these tips are the most effective for you, slip on the Oura Ring to see how they impact your sleep quality.

  "sleep_tips_title": "Here are 10 of the best tips to get better sleep.",
  "sleep_tips_track_description": "Knowledge is power. You’ll need to know how good your sleep quality is to know how to improve it. You can track your sleep with the Oura Ring. Oura accurately tracks your sleep quality and sleep cycle trends with research-grade sensors packed in a lightweight, comfortable ring. You’ll know if you’re getting enough deep, light and REM sleep every night and how to improve it.",
  "sleep_tips_track_title": "To understand your sleep, track it.",
  "sleep_tips_unwind_description": "Of course, this one is easier said than done. However, if you reserve time to unwind—by employing practices like taking a relaxing bubble bath, putting on some soothing sleep sounds, or reading a novel—you train your body to enter a relaxed state. Like a muscle: the more you practice engaging your rest-and-digest system while you’re awake, the easier it becomes to generate that same response at night.",
