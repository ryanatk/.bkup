# dotfiles

Project to store my own personal dotfiles:
* separate bashrc files for different os and environments
* vimrc

and software downloads and setup:
* chrome, firefox, macvim, dropbox, etc
* git completion


# structure

* Add files here in the project's root,
  naming them how you want them to appear in your home directory,
  but without the dot prefix.

* To use multiple separate files (for organization's sake),
  instead create a directory, and add the separate files.
  You will be prompted whether to source each separate file,
  with the exception of "main" and "private", which will always
  be included when present (private will never be version controlled).
